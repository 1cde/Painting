# Painting
In my project, I utilized CSS to center h1 and img elements, set a light blue background for the page, and created a canvas within a black-bordered frame. Three distinct elements (one, two, and three) exhibit unique widths, heights, colors, and effects. The overall design integrates centering, backgrounds, borders, visually appealing layout.
